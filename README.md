# raspberry_pico_w_python

The .py code was uploaded to the raspberry pi by saving the file as main.py in the pi memory. It is important that the filename has that exact name.
You should look at the following library in thonny IDE.

You can use the vscode serial monitor window with a baud rate of 19200 if you are interested in seeing the pi respond without interruption. 

This program can be refactor. 

Comments:
